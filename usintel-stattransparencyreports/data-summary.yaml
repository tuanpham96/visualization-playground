      usually in Figure 6
      due to the report of Priv & Civil Lib Oversight Board (PCLOB), this stat was tracked from 2015     
      2015-2020 only include NSA, CIA, NCTC
      NCTC included both contents and noncontents in this field?
      only recently 2021 include FBI separately
      content is basically unique query term
      "excluding search terms used to prevent the return of U.S. person information"?
      unclear difference between "content" and "noncontent"?

      noncontent (i.e. metadata), number of queries not unique 
      does not contain FBI queries?
      CIA only began 2018 estimates, before CIA not reporting this
      only NSA and CIA, no NTCT here?
